                They are among us. Blood-drinking, flesh-eating, shape-shifting extraterrestrial reptilian humanoids with only one objective in their cold-blooded little heads: to enslave the human race. They are our leaders, our corporate executives, our beloved Oscar-winning actors and Grammy-winning singers, and they're responsible for the Holocaust, the Oklahoma City bombings and the 9/11 attacks ... at least according to former BBC sports reporter David Icke, who became the poster human for the theory in 1998 after publishing his first book, The Biggest Secret, which contained interviews with two Brits who claimed members of the royal family are nothing more than reptiles with crowns.

The conspiracy theorist and New Age philosopher, who wore only turquoise for a time and insisted on being called Son of God-Head, says these "Annunaki" (the reptiles) have controlled humankind since ancient times; they count among their number Queen Elizabeth, George W. Bush, Henry Kissinger, Bill and Hillary Clinton and Bob Hope. Encroaching on other conspiracy theorists' territory, Icke even claims that the lizards are behind secret societies like the Freemasons and the Illuminati. Since earning the dubious title of "paranoid of the decade" in the late 1990s, Icke has written several books on the topic, including his latest work, The David Icke Guide to the Global Conspiracy, while operating his own website — complete with merchandise and advertisements.

                It's now been nearly four decades since Neil Armstrong took his "giant leap for mankind" — if, that is, he ever set foot off this planet. Doubters say the U.S. government, desperate to beat the Russians in the space race, faked the lunar landings, with Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin acting out their mission on a secret film set, located (depending on the theory) either high in the Hollywood Hills or deep within Area 51. With the photos and videos of the Apollo missions only available through NASA, there's no independent verification that the lunar landings were anything but a hoax.

The smoking gun? Film of Aldrin planting a waving American flag on the moon, which critics say proves that he was not in space. The flag's movement, they say, clearly shows the presence of wind, which is impossible in a vacuum. NASA says Aldrin was twisting the flagpole to get the moon soil, which caused the flag to move. (And never mind that astronauts have brought back hundreds of independently verified moon rocks.) Theorists have even suggested that filmmaker Stanley Kubrick may have helped NASA fake the first lunar landing, given that his 1968 film 2001: A Space Odessey proves that the technology existed back then to artificially create a spacelike set. And as for Virgil I. Grissom, Edward H. White and Roger B. Chaffee — three astronauts who died in a fire while testing equipment for the first moon mission? They were executed by the U.S. government, which feared they were about to disclose the truth.

Far-fetched as the hoax theory may seem, a 1999 Gallup poll showed that it's comparatively durable: 6% of Americans said they thought the lunar landings were fake, and 5% said they were undecided.

                The renowned Italian polymath Galileo Galilei introduced one of the most famous mathematical paradoxes in his final written work. In his work Discourses and Mathematical Demonstrations Relating to Two New Sciences (1638), he discussed his Paradox of the Infinite.
    
    Suppose there are two sets of numbers. One set contains all square numbers such as 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, and so on until infinity. The other set contains numbers that are not squares such as 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, and so on until infinity. When you combine these two sets, you will end up with a set with more numbers than just the two sets separately. The total number of squares will surely be less than all the numbers together. However, each positive number only has exactly one square and cannot possibly contain more numbers than the other set.
    
    This paradox left Galileo with the conclusion that concepts such as more, less, and equal only apply to finite sets of numbers. They don’t apply to infinite sets. Later works by German mathematician Georg Cantor then drew the conclusion that some infinite sets are larger than others.

                This paradox follows a condemned prisoner that a judge sentenced to death by hanging. The judge tells the prisoner that the executioner will hang him at noon on a weekday in the following week. He also told the prisoner that the day of the execution will be a surprise. Thus, the prisoner will not know the exact day of his execution. He will only know the day of his hanging when the executioner comes knocking on his cell door.
    The prisoner, upon hearing his punishment, reflected on it and concluded that he’ll be able to escape his execution. Because the execution will happen on a weekday, he argued that his execution can’t be on a Friday because the judge told him that the day will be a surprise to him. Therefore, when Thursday passes and he’s still alive, he will know that the execution will be on Friday. This means that the day of the hanging won’t come as a surprise to him anymore.
    After drawing the conclusion that the day of his execution can’t occur on a Friday, he reasons further and states that his execution cannot be on a Thursday either. That’s because when he’s still alive when Wednesday noon passes, then the hanging must be on a Thursday, given that he already ruled out the possibility of a Friday execution. Therefore, a Thursday execution will not be a surprise as well. Using the same line of reasoning, he further argued that the execution also won’t occur on a Wednesday, a Tuesday, or a Monday. After making his arguments, he happily went back to his cell. He was confident that the surprise hanging will not happen at all.
    When the week of the execution came, the executioner knocked on the prisoner’s cell door on a Wednesday. This came as a surprise to the prisoner, who was confident that the execution wouldn’t happen at all. Thus, what the judge told him eventually came true.
    The unexpected hanging paradox has a lot of other versions, such as those involving a surprise test or pop quiz. Many philosophers also attempted to resolve this paradox, but there is no unanimous agreement on its nature and resolution. Some even say that it remains a significant problem in philosophy to this day, and that’s why it’s among the most famous paradoxes!
