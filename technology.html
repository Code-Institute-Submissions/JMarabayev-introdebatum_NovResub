                From SIRI to self-driving cars, artificial intelligence (AI) is progressing rapidly. While science fiction often portrays AI as robots with human-like characteristics, AI can encompass anything from Google’s search algorithms to IBM’s Watson to autonomous weapons.

Artificial intelligence today is properly known as narrow AI (or weak AI), in that it is designed to perform a narrow task (e.g. only facial recognition or only internet searches or only driving a car). However, the long-term goal of many researchers is to create general AI (AGI or strong AI). While narrow AI may outperform humans at whatever its specific task is, like playing chess or solving equations, AGI would outperform humans at nearly every cognitive task.

                It is crystal clear that there are advantages and disadvantages to everything in everyone’s life, and that includes our social networking habits. The practical advantages and disadvantages of social media are a subject of frequent discussion. Participation in social media by the general public has increased sharply over the past nine years. In the U.S., the percentage of adults using social media has increased from 8% to 72% since 2005. Using social media is widespread across all ages and professions and is common around the world.

Social media enables users to connect with others and create a community. It’s more about building relationships than simply announcing or posting and not engaging with others. It is undeniably changing the way one communicates.

                The renowned Italian polymath Galileo Galilei introduced one of the most famous mathematical paradoxes in his final written work. In his work Discourses and Mathematical Demonstrations Relating to Two New Sciences (1638), he discussed his Paradox of the Infinite.
    
    Suppose there are two sets of numbers. One set contains all square numbers such as 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, and so on until infinity. The other set contains numbers that are not squares such as 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, and so on until infinity. When you combine these two sets, you will end up with a set with more numbers than just the two sets separately. The total number of squares will surely be less than all the numbers together. However, each positive number only has exactly one square and cannot possibly contain more numbers than the other set.
    
    This paradox left Galileo with the conclusion that concepts such as more, less, and equal only apply to finite sets of numbers. They don’t apply to infinite sets. Later works by German mathematician Georg Cantor then drew the conclusion that some infinite sets are larger than others.

                This paradox follows a condemned prisoner that a judge sentenced to death by hanging. The judge tells the prisoner that the executioner will hang him at noon on a weekday in the following week. He also told the prisoner that the day of the execution will be a surprise. Thus, the prisoner will not know the exact day of his execution. He will only know the day of his hanging when the executioner comes knocking on his cell door.
    The prisoner, upon hearing his punishment, reflected on it and concluded that he’ll be able to escape his execution. Because the execution will happen on a weekday, he argued that his execution can’t be on a Friday because the judge told him that the day will be a surprise to him. Therefore, when Thursday passes and he’s still alive, he will know that the execution will be on Friday. This means that the day of the hanging won’t come as a surprise to him anymore.
    After drawing the conclusion that the day of his execution can’t occur on a Friday, he reasons further and states that his execution cannot be on a Thursday either. That’s because when he’s still alive when Wednesday noon passes, then the hanging must be on a Thursday, given that he already ruled out the possibility of a Friday execution. Therefore, a Thursday execution will not be a surprise as well. Using the same line of reasoning, he further argued that the execution also won’t occur on a Wednesday, a Tuesday, or a Monday. After making his arguments, he happily went back to his cell. He was confident that the surprise hanging will not happen at all.
    When the week of the execution came, the executioner knocked on the prisoner’s cell door on a Wednesday. This came as a surprise to the prisoner, who was confident that the execution wouldn’t happen at all. Thus, what the judge told him eventually came true.
    The unexpected hanging paradox has a lot of other versions, such as those involving a surprise test or pop quiz. Many philosophers also attempted to resolve this paradox, but there is no unanimous agreement on its nature and resolution. Some even say that it remains a significant problem in philosophy to this day, and that’s why it’s among the most famous paradoxes!
