                From SIRI to self-driving cars, artificial intelligence (AI) is progressing rapidly. While science fiction often portrays AI as robots with human-like characteristics, AI can encompass anything from Google’s search algorithms to IBM’s Watson to autonomous weapons.

Artificial intelligence today is properly known as narrow AI (or weak AI), in that it is designed to perform a narrow task (e.g. only facial recognition or only internet searches or only driving a car). However, the long-term goal of many researchers is to create general AI (AGI or strong AI). While narrow AI may outperform humans at whatever its specific task is, like playing chess or solving equations, AGI would outperform humans at nearly every cognitive task.

                It is crystal clear that there are advantages and disadvantages to everything in everyone’s life, and that includes our social networking habits. The practical advantages and disadvantages of social media are a subject of frequent discussion. Participation in social media by the general public has increased sharply over the past nine years. In the U.S., the percentage of adults using social media has increased from 8% to 72% since 2005. Using social media is widespread across all ages and professions and is common around the world.

Social media enables users to connect with others and create a community. It’s more about building relationships than simply announcing or posting and not engaging with others. It is undeniably changing the way one communicates.

                Proposed changes to the Highway Code would mean that users of self-driving cars would not be held responsible for vehicle crashes.

The Department for Transport (DfT) has said that insurance companies would instead be liable for collision claims. The updated code, which is expected to come into effect in the summer, will also allow people to watch TV on built-in screens, but drivers will need to be ready to take back control of their vehicles if prompted. Using a mobile phone while driving will remain illegal. 

Driverless cars have “remained tantalisingly just beyond the horizon” for some years, but “the technology appears poised for a leap forward in 2022”, said GreenBiz. No cars are yet approved to self-drive on UK roads, but the DfT has said the first could be ready for use this year.
This however does not stop the debate of whether self-driving or driverless car are the right way forward, there are many pros and cons to review and discuss.
