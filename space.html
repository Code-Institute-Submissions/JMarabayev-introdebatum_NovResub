            The ultimate goal of NASA's exoplanet program is to find unmistakable signs of current life on a planet beyond Earth. How soon that can happen depends on two unknowns: the prevalence of life in the galaxy and how lucky we get as we take those first, tentative, exploratory steps.
            The odds seem a bit better now that we’ve confirmed more than 4,000 exoplanets in our galaxy, about a fifth of them in Earth’s size-range. We know the building blocks of life are present throughout the solar system and the cosmos, and that includes water.

We don’t know how readily life begins, whether it’s common or rare, how long it endures. Up the ante to intelligent life, and the questions only multiply.

That includes one of the most famous questions of all: Where is everybody? Physicist Enrico Fermi posed it back in 1950 during lunch with fellow physicists, igniting decades of debate. Even at a leisurely, slower-than-light pace, the reasoning went, our galaxy could be easily crossed by a spacefaring civilization within a few million years. The Milky Way galaxy is presently pushing 14 billion. And while it took 4-billion-plus- years for technological intelligence to develop on our planet, the galaxy contains plenty of planetary systems of comparable age, as well as others much older.

            In the film The Matrix, Agent Smith (actually a super-computer in human shape) says: “I’d like to share a revelation that I’ve had during my time here. It came to me when I tried to classify your species. I realized that you’re not actually mammals. Every mammal on this planet instinctively develops a natural equilibrium with the surrounding environment, but you humans do not. You move to an area, and you multiply, and multiply, until every natural resource is consumed. The only way you can survive is to spread to another area. There is another organism on this planet that follows the same pattern: a virus. Human beings are a disease, a cancer of this planet. You are a plague, and we are the cure.”
            The idea of humans as a virus species is becoming increasingly widespread, and with good reason. Human numbers grow exponentially as we feed parasitically on the ‘body’ of the earth. No part of the planet is left untouched as we swarm over it, multiplying, polluting, consuming, destroying. Whereas most species live in balance with their ecosystems, we seem incapable of doing so.

            They swallow up everything around them and inside there is only the deepest darkness. But they are surrounded by a spectacular light show. Black holes are a fascinating phenomenon in the universe. The mass inside a black hole is so compact that it swallows everything up and nothing can escape from it. Not even light can escape. It therefore does not travel in straight lines and is strongly distorted.

We know what a black hole looks like thanks to an image from April 2019: a dark eye surrounded by a ring of light. The Oscar-winning Hollywood movie Interstellar depicted a black hole in spectacular fashion. The dark eye plays a key role in this sci-fi blockbuster. The black hole provides the main character’s spaceship with enough speed to keep flying, so that he can ultimately save humanity. The way this was depicted received tremendous praise both within and outside the academic world. Many scientists worked on the film. One of them was American Nobel Prize winner and astrophysicist Kip Thorne. The depiction of the black hole even resulted in scientific publications.
Suppose that we find a way to harnass the gravitational power of black holes, this would open a new paradigm in space exploration and travel.
