<h2>About the platform.</h2>
<p>
    Greetings! Welcome to the about section of "Introdebatum" an online static platform for group discussion ideas, debate topics and prompts for self education, exploration and reflection!
</p>
<p>It is very easy to use the platfrom. Simply navigate to the category of your choice! (e.g. Time Travel) and click it to expand the topic list within that category. Once you have settled on a topic that you would like to explore further simply click that topic and you will be taken to a page with textual and audio/visual introduction to the topic which would give you some background knowledge required to getyou started. Towards the bottom you would find some suggested questions to spark up your debate.</p>
