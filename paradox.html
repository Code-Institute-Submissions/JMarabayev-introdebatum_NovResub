            The grandfather paradox is a self-contradictory situation that arises in some time travel scenarios that is illustrated by the impossible scenario in which a person travels back in time only to kill their grandfather (who could no longer go on to produce one's parent, and hence where does that leave you and your ancestor-killing event?). The paradox is sometimes taken as an argument against the logical possibility of traveling backward in time, according to the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. Within the framework of modern physics, however, there are ways to avoid the paradox without dispensing with time travel altogether.
            Let's suppose you have a time machine that allows you to travel back into the past. While you're there, you accidentally kill one of your grandparents — or any other direct ancestor — before they have any offspring. That would alter a whole chain of future events, including your own birth, which would no longer happen. But if you weren't born in the future, then you couldn't kill your ancestor in the past — hence the paradox. It's a scenario that became popular in the science-fiction magazines of the 1920s and 1930s, according to the Historical Dictionary of Science Fiction, and the name "grandfather paradox" was firmly established by 1950.

Actually, you don't even need to kill anyone; there are many other ways you could change history that would result in your future non-existence. Perhaps the best known example is the movie "Back to the Future," in which the time-traveling protagonist inadvertently drives a wedge between his parents before they were married — and then has to work frantically to bring them together again.

            The existence of evil and suffering in our world seems to pose a serious challenge to belief in the existence of a perfect God. If God were all-knowing, it seems that God would know about all of the horrible things that happen in our world. If God were all-powerful, God would be able to do something about all of the evil and suffering. Furthermore, if God were morally perfect, then surely God would want to do something about it. And yet we find that our world is filled with countless instances of evil and suffering.  These facts about evil and suffering seem to conflict with the orthodox theist claim that there exists a perfectly good God. The challenged posed by this apparent conflict has come to be known as the problem of evil.

            The renowned Italian polymath Galileo Galilei introduced one of the most famous mathematical paradoxes in his final written work. In his work Discourses and Mathematical Demonstrations Relating to Two New Sciences (1638), he discussed his Paradox of the Infinite.

Suppose there are two sets of numbers. One set contains all square numbers such as 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, and so on until infinity. The other set contains numbers that are not squares such as 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, and so on until infinity. When you combine these two sets, you will end up with a set with more numbers than just the two sets separately. The total number of squares will surely be less than all the numbers together. However, each positive number only has exactly one square and cannot possibly contain more numbers than the other set.

This paradox left Galileo with the conclusion that concepts such as more, less, and equal only apply to finite sets of numbers. They don’t apply to infinite sets. Later works by German mathematician Georg Cantor then drew the conclusion that some infinite sets are larger than others.

            This paradox follows a condemned prisoner that a judge sentenced to death by hanging. The judge tells the prisoner that the executioner will hang him at noon on a weekday in the following week. He also told the prisoner that the day of the execution will be a surprise. Thus, the prisoner will not know the exact day of his execution. He will only know the day of his hanging when the executioner comes knocking on his cell door.
The prisoner, upon hearing his punishment, reflected on it and concluded that he’ll be able to escape his execution. Because the execution will happen on a weekday, he argued that his execution can’t be on a Friday because the judge told him that the day will be a surprise to him. Therefore, when Thursday passes and he’s still alive, he will know that the execution will be on Friday. This means that the day of the hanging won’t come as a surprise to him anymore.
After drawing the conclusion that the day of his execution can’t occur on a Friday, he reasons further and states that his execution cannot be on a Thursday either. That’s because when he’s still alive when Wednesday noon passes, then the hanging must be on a Thursday, given that he already ruled out the possibility of a Friday execution. Therefore, a Thursday execution will not be a surprise as well. Using the same line of reasoning, he further argued that the execution also won’t occur on a Wednesday, a Tuesday, or a Monday. After making his arguments, he happily went back to his cell. He was confident that the surprise hanging will not happen at all.
When the week of the execution came, the executioner knocked on the prisoner’s cell door on a Wednesday. This came as a surprise to the prisoner, who was confident that the execution wouldn’t happen at all. Thus, what the judge told him eventually came true.
The unexpected hanging paradox has a lot of other versions, such as those involving a surprise test or pop quiz. Many philosophers also attempted to resolve this paradox, but there is no unanimous agreement on its nature and resolution. Some even say that it remains a significant problem in philosophy to this day, and that’s why it’s among the most famous paradoxes!
